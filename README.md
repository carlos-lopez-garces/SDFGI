# SDFGI (Signed Distance Field Global Illumination)

SDFGI is an SDF-based variant of Dynamic Diffuse Global Illumination that doesn’t need hardware accelerated ray-tracing. Pioneered by Godot’s Co-Creator, Juan Linietsky and released for Godot 4.0 in 2023.
SDFGI estimates an irradiance field for an SDF representation of the scene and samples it to obtain indirect diffuse light contributions.
