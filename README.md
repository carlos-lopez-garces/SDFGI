**Signed Distance Field Global Illumination (SDFGI) is a solution to real-time diffuse global illumination for games.**

SDFGI is a variant of Dynamic Diffuse Global Illumination (DDGI) that takes advantage of Signed Distance Fields (SDFs). Since SDFGI uses an SDF of to ray-march the scene, it does not require hardware accelerated ray-tracing, unlike DDGI. Our implementation is inspired by a similar DDGI approach in Godot 4.0, which was released in 2023 and pioneered by Godot's co-creator, Juan Linietsky. 

This is a DirectX12 implementation built on top of a starter project provided my Microsoft, MiniEngine, as part of their [DirectX Samples repo](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples/tree/master/MiniEngine). 

Features include: 
* Arbitrary glTF loading
* Dynamic lighting
* Arbitrary irradiance probe placement
* Cube-Map DDGI: A non-dynamic version of DDGI that serves as a reference implementation to compare our final results.

## üìú Implementation Details

This section details our implementation of SDFGI.

### üèÅ SDF Representation

#### GPU Voxelization

#### 3D Jump Flood Algorithm

#### Ray-Marching the Scene

### üßä Cube Map Representation

### üí° Irradiance Probes

Irradiance probes are a type of cache that can be sampled from during a final graphics pass to produce lighting in indirect areas. As per DDGI, these probes are computed and updated per-frame, so dynamic lighting is possible. These probes cover a volume in the world that covers the entire scene. While each probe is represented as a position in world-space, the irradiance information of each probe is actually stored in a 3D texture known as an Irradiance Atlas. 

#### Probe Placement

#### Irradiance & Depth Atlas

##### Octahedral Encoding

#### Updating Probes

#### Sampling Probes
